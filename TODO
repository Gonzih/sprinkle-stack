== TODO

-- HIGH-PRIO

* test on new image
* change "ubuntu" user to deployer vs. add files for this user as well? (Read up)
* nginx.conf: Use proper Ruby version?
* monit: finalize
* ufw: finalize
* secure SSH:
    - /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      PermitRootLogin yes => PermitRootLogin no
      PasswordAuthentication yes => PasswordAuthentication no
      (...and restart SSH service)

-- LOWER-PRIO

* EC2-tools package: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EC2StartersGuide
* optional: setup should ask for PEM-file (requires Sprinkle patch it seems...)
    - http://www.denofubiquity.com/ruby/bootstrapping-a-deploy-user-with-capistrano-on-ec2/
* consider using one user per site, i.e. "/home/example.com/app/..."
* shell/bash: Consider: https://github.com/revans/bash-it

-- MAYBE

* SSL

* backup all existing files by renaming with suffix ".original"
* would be very cool/useful: log changes to file system to make it possible to undo/redo entire stack if things goes wrong (migrations kind of)
    Example:
      /sprinkle/                        # sprinkle root
      /sprinkle/setup.log               # sprinkle log containing all file modifications (example: ALTERED /etc/sudoers, NEW /etc/hello, ...)
      /sprinkle/backup/**/*.original    # where original (altered/removed) files are backed up
* look into vagrant, maybe to provide localhost tryout/testing:
    - http://vagrantup.com

* appserver-packages: unicorn, thin, node.js
* document-databases: mongodb
* search-packages: solr, thinking_spinx
* cms-packages: wordpress + php
