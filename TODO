== TODO

-- HIGH-PRIO

* ruby/rvm + zsh: right now the init script is only added to .bashrc - fix this
* monit: finalize
* postgres: roles, root password, append iptables-rule
    - http://articles.slicehost.com/postgresql
* mysql: roles, root password, config, append iptables-rule
    - http://articles.slicehost.com/mysql
    - http://www.rndguy.ca/2010/02/24/fully-automated-ubuntu-server-setups-using-preseed/
* variable everywhere: deployer, group, deploy_to, install-prefix (e.g. '/usr/local'), ...
* make use of ERB in templates (config value interpolation)
* if required config values are not set (such as host, in say deploy.rb) - ask for a value before continue
* secure SSH:
    - /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      PermitRootLogin yes => PermitRootLogin no
      PasswordAuthentication yes => PasswordAuthentication no

      (...and restart SSH service)
* firewall: Consider ufw ("uncomplicated firewall") - because iptable rules is usually overkill

-- LOWER-PRIO

* consider using one user per site, i.e. "/home/example.com/app/..."
* change "ubuntu" user to deployer vs. add files for this user as well? (Read up)
* document-databases: mongodb
* keyvalue-stores:

-- MAYBE

* shell/bash: Consider: https://github.com/revans/bash-it
* backup all exisiting files by renaming with suffix ".original"
* SSL

* would be very cool/useful: log changes to file system to make it possible to undo/redo entire stack if things goes wrong (migrations kind of)
    Example:
      /sprinkle/                        # sprinkle root
      /sprinkle/setup.log               # sprinkle log containing all file modifications (example: ALTERED /etc/sudoers, NEW /etc/hello, ...)
      /sprinkle/backup/**/*.original    # where original (altered/removed) files are backed up
* look into vagrant, maybe to provide localhost tryout/testing:

* appserver-packages: unicorn, thin, node.js
* search-packages: solr, thinking_spinx
* cms-packages: wordpress + php
